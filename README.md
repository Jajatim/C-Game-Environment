What you need to use this ?
- SDL 2


What to do with that ?
- Initialize all objects in gameInit.c (it is safe to delete everything in the function)
- Update whatever you like in gameUpdate.c (it is safe to delete everything in the function)


More specific things to do ?
- Choose window size, max objects, render&update timers in define.h
- If you need to render something differently from a rectangle, you can have a peek in render.c


What's to come ?
- More in depth object configuration and possibilities
- Object animation (with sprite sheets)
- We'll see
